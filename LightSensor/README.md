# Light Sensor
I made an Application that can change app theme according to light sensor's data!

## How does this App work?
When the light sensor's data is larger or equal to 10 lux, the application will switch to a light theme.
When the light sensor's data is smaller than 1000 lux, the application will switch to a dark theme.


| *Light Theme* | *Dark Theme* |
